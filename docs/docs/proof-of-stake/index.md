# Proof-of-stake (POS)

## Overview

Kowala uses its own custom implementation of Tendermint. Tendermint is a weakly synchronous, Byzantine fault tolerant, state machine replication protocol, with optimal Byzantine fault tolerance and additional accountability guarantees in the event the BFT assumptions are violated.

Features include the user of a smart contract as the validator registry for registering validators while making a deposit and contains the logic to report byzantine validators - destroy their deposit. Additionaly Tendermint provides fast finality that can be as fast as 1 second per block depending on the validators hardware requirements.
